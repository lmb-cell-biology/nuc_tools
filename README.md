# Nucleome tools

The nuc_tools software is a collection of nucleome analysis tools with an emphasis on genome structure.

Individual tools are provided for the processing, analysis and visualisation of chromatin contact data 
in combination with asscociated data like ChIP-seq.

This includes canonical, multi-cell Hi-C data as well as single-cell Hi-C. Some tools are also provided
for the analysis of whole genome structure that derive from single-cell Hi-C data.
